# Riotz

## Project Description

**Riotz** is a private bus tracking open-sourced web application built using Django. It provides users with an intuitive interface to search for available buses between two locations in Kerala, view their schedules, and see their routes on a map using OpenStreetMap. This was a project done by one of my friends [CLP](https://github.com/chethaslp) and I decided to give it a try for implementing a route visualisation. Check out his project too, [Wizmybus](https://github.com/chethaslp/wizmybus). Alr let's check out more abt this project below!

This project was developed for **FOSSathon**_(Hackathon conducted by FOSS @CEAL)_ during the college fest [Daksha Yanthra](https://www.instagram.com/dakshayanthra/) '25.
